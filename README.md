## 👋 Hi, I'm Akhil Nallacheruvu

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher working at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and systems design. I focus on translating learning-based methods into deployable, resource-aware implementations that integrate tightly with hardware and embedded platforms. My work spans algorithm development, optimization-based estimation, and computer architecture, with an emphasis on building end-to-end intelligent systems.

### 💻 Top Projects

- **[Active Learning for Object Detection](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/fishDetAL)**  
  Active learning framework for underwater object detection, improving annotation efficiency and model performance in vision systems.

- **[Orientation Tracking with Projected Gradient Descent](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/orientation_tracking)**  
  IMU-based 3D orientation tracking using constrained quaternion trajectory optimization via projected gradient descent, applied to panoramic image reconstruction.

- **[Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/ooo_processor)**  
  32-bit out-of-order superscalar RISC-V processor implementing dynamic scheduling, register renaming, and instruction-level parallelism.

- **[Shortest Path Algorithms Exploration](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/Final-Project-CS225)**  
  Comparative implementation and analysis of Dijkstra’s and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms for GPS-style routing applications.

- **[Vaccine Research Data Analysis](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/vaccine_research)**  
  Bioinformatics data analysis integrating statistical modeling and computational methods for vaccine research.
