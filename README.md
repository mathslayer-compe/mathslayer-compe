## 👋 Hi, I'm Akhil Nallacheruvu

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher specializing in Computer Vision and Embedded AI Systems. I focus on translating ML research into deployable solutions that integrate tightly with hardware constraints.

### 💻 Top Projects

- **[Active Learning for Object Detection](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/fishDetAL)**  
  Research project exploring the application of active learning strategies to underwater object detection and vision systems.

- **[Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/ooo_processor)**  
  32-bit out-of-order superscalar RISC-V processor implementing dynamic scheduling and instruction-level parallelism.

- **[Shortest Path Algorithms Exploration](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/Final-Project-CS225)**  
  Comparative analysis of Dijkstra’s and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms, with applications to GPS-style routing systems.

- **[Vaccine Research Data Analysis](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/vaccine_research)**  
  Bioinformatics-focused data analysis integrating statistical modeling and computational methods for vaccine research.

- **[Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/mathslayer-compe/ML)**  
  Implementations bridging machine learning theory and practical Python-based experimentation.
